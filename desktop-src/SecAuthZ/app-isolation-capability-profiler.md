# Application capability profiler (ACP)

Packaged applications may need to access resources outside of the sandbox. Examples of such resources include user files, pictures, registry items, camera, location, and microphone, among others. Capability declaration allows sandboxed applications to access some of those resources. Declarations are made in the sandboxed application's package manifest. See msix-packaging-tool for reference.

Application capability profiler is a set of tools that help identify what capabilities may need to be declared by an application package, so it's granted the resource access it needs. Furthermore, it provides useful diagnostic information on failed access attempts by the application package.

## Prepare the target system for profiling

The follow steps are required to set up the target system for profiling:

1. Ensure your user account has administrator privilege to the target Windows system.
1. Enable developer mode on the target system. This setting can be found in Windows Settings | Privacy & security | For developers. See [Enable your device for development](/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) for more information.
1. Install PowerShell 7.3 or later. See [Installing PowerShell on Windows](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows) for installation instructions.

   This is required for [Microsoft.Windows.Win32Isolation.ApplicationCapabilityProfiler](app-isolation-reference/Microsoft.Windows.Win32Isolation.ApplicationCapabilityProfiler.md) module compatibility.

1. Install Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) if not already installed and add it to PATH.

   See [Windows Performance Recorder](/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-recorder) for instructions.

   ```PowerShell
   Get-Command wpr
   ```

   :::image type="content" source="images/app-isolation/acp-doc-get-command-wpr-output.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Get-Command cmdlet executing in a PowerShell command prompt":::

1. Download the application capability profiler archive and extract it to a convenient path.

   The application capability profiler archive can be downloaded from this project's [release assets](https://github.com/microsoft/win32-app-isolation/releases).

1. Follow the instructions on [Package isolated Win32 apps with Visual Studio](app-isolation-packaging-with-vs.md) to package the application and install it on the target system.

1. Obtain the target application package manifest (recommended) and/or the target application package full name.

   1. **(Recommended)** Obtain the target application package manifest. The easiest way to do this is to open it using [Visual Studio](app-isolation-packaging-with-vs.md) and save a copy of the manifest to a convenient path.

   1. Obtain the application package full name by running the following command in PowerShell:

      ```PowerShell
      Get-AppxPackage | where-object {$_.name -like '*Test-AppSilo*'}
      ```

      :::image type="content" source="images/app-isolation/acp-doc-get-appxpackage-output.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Get-AppxPackage command output":::

1. **(Optional)** Install the Windows Performance Analyzer. See [Windows Performance Analyzer](/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer) for instructions. This is not required for profiling but may be helpful in visualizing some of the data captured and output by ACP.

## Import the PowerShell module

Information about the module can be found here: [Microsoft.Windows.Win32Isolation.ApplicationCapabilityProfiler](app-isolation-reference/Microsoft.Windows.Win32Isolation.ApplicationCapabilityProfiler.md).

Run the following command in PowerShell with administrator privileges to import the module:

```PowerShell
Import-Module .\Microsoft.Windows.Win32Isolation.ApplicationCapabilityProfiler.dll
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft.Windows.Win32Isolation.ApplicationCapabilityProfiler.dll module is located in the ACP folder extracted from the archive in step 5 of the [Prepare the target system for profiling](#prepare-the-target-system-for-profiling) instructions above.

## Start profiling

The **Start-Profiling** cmdlet takes the path to the target application package manifest or the full name of the application package.

**Start-Profiling** will instrument the target application package for trace logging and enable a trace logging provider for access attempts made by the target application package. See [Start-Profiling](app-isolation-reference/Start-Profiling.md) for more information.

Run the following command in PowerShell with administrator privileges to start profiling:

```PowerShell
Start-Profiling -ManifestPath TestApp-AppXManifest.xml
```

:::image type="content" source="images/app-isolation/acp-doc-start-profiling-output.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing a PowerShell command window executing the Start-Profiling cmdlet":::

## Run the application scenarios

In this step, it is important that all the critical application scenarios are run. Profiling results are as comprehensive as the scenarios run at this step. The more application scenarios are exercised, the larger and more complete the amount of data captured by the trace logging session started above.

## Stop profiling

The **Stop-Profiling** cmdlet stops an access attempt trace logging session that has been started and removes the instrumentation for any application packages that were instrumented for trace logging.

**Stop-Profiling** accepts an optional trace path parameter that controls the path used for the output Event Trace Log (.etl) file. `<current_directory>\trace.etl` by default. See [Stop-Profiling](app-isolation-reference/Stop-Profiling.md) for more information.

Run the following command in PowerShell with administrator privileges to stop profiling:

```PowerShell
Stop-Profiling
```

:::image type="content" source="images/app-isolation/acp-doc-stop-profiling-output.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing a PowerShell command window executing the Stop-Profiling cmdlet":::

## Get the profiling results

The **Get-ProfilingResults** cmdlet parses the trace file obtained from the steps above and finds the capabilities required by the application package(s) identified in the trace. It outputs the capabilities and information for every application package identified in the trace, unless filters to a specific package were specified.

**Get-ProfilingResults** accepts the path to the trace file to be parsed. If no path is provided, **Get-ProfilingResults** will attempt to invoke **Stop-Profiling** to obtain a trace to parse.

**Get-ProfilingResults** optionally takes a path to a target application manifest. If information in the parsed trace can be attributed to the target application package manifest, the file is edited directly with the output capabilities. Otherwise, a copy of the manifest is made for each of the packages identified in the trace, adding the identified capabilities.

See [Get-ProfilingResults](app-isolation-reference/Get-ProfilingResults.md) for details.

The following command will parse the trace file and output the results:

```PowerShell
Get-ProfilingResults -EtlFilePaths trace.etl -ManifestPath TestApp-AppXManifest.xml
```

:::image type="content" source="images/app-isolation/acp-doc-get-profilingresults-output.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing a PowerShell command window executing the Get-ProfilingResults cmdlet":::

## Repackaging the app

To repackage the target application with the newly identified capabilities:

1. Include the newly identified capabilities in the target application package manifest (**Get-ProfilingResults** will edit the manifest directly if provided).
1. Follow instructions in [Package isolated Win32 apps with Visual Studio](app-isolation-packaging-with-vs.md) to repackage the target application with the new capabilities, and reinstall it.

## Helper cmdlets

The [Merge-ProfilingResults](app-isolation-reference/Merge-ProfilingResults.md) cmdlet can be used to merge the output from multiple runs of **Get-ProfilingResults**.

## Interpreting the profiling output

The output of **Get-ProfilingResults** consists of the following:

1. Manifest-formatted capabilities

   If the user provides a manifest to be edited with the `-ManifestPath` switch *and* the package to which the manifest belongs is identified in the input trace, **Get-ProfilingResults** will edit the manifest file directly to include the capabilities identified in the trace for the package. Otherwise, for each package identified in the trace file, **Get-ProfilingResults** will output a file named `<package full name><manifest name>.xml` containing the `<Capabilities>` element with the capabilities identified in the trace for the corresponding package.

   > [!NOTE]
   > There are two special kinds of capabilities that **Get-ProfilingResults** may identify. These results are flagged with XML comments in the output manifest.

   - **Privacy-sensitive capabilities**: These capabilities protect privacy-sensitive resources such as camera, location, and microphone. These capabilities must be declared if the application package requires access to these resources. However, capability declaration alone may not be sufficient to ensure application access to the target privacy-sensitive resource. In privacy settings, the user can still grant or deny resource access to the application.
   - **Prompting capability**: **Get-ProfilingResults** will output this capability in "commented-out" form when it identifies that the prompting capability may apply to an application package. If declared in the package manifest, the application is opted *into* fallback prompting. User prompts will be issued every time the application has its access denied to a prompting-eligible resource. This gives the user a chance to explicitly grant or deny access to the resource. Fallback prompting can be intrusive and weaken the sandbox, so it should be used with caution, preferably only when required for critical application scenarios.

1. AccessAttemptRecords.csv

   This is a comma-separated values file containing detailed diagnostic information about parsed trace events and each failed access attempt logged for the application package.

1. summary.txt

   This is a summary of all runs of **Get-ProfilingResults**. Each run appends to this file. `-SummaryOutputPath` can be used to modify this filepath.

   The summary contains the inputs parsed, target application packages and executables, identified capabilities, edited manifest contents, and a summarized list of all the resources that the application package attempted to access but for which no capabilities were identified.

  > [!NOTE]
  > It's possible that the target application won't be able to access these resources when packaged.

1. README.txt

   This file contains information for all runs of **Get-ProfilingResults**. Each time the script runs, it appends to this file.

   The **README** provides information about the input parsed, target application package, files output and their paths, as well as a troubleshooting guide.

## Stack tracing

The ACP archive contains a file named ACP-StackTrace.wpaProfile. This is a profile for [Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA)](/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer). It enables stack trace visualization for the event trace log file captured by **Stop-Profiling**. It breaks down access attempts, their target, and the stack that issued the attempt. This enables a more complete understanding of the reasons why the target application is not able to access specific resources.

To visualize access attempt stacks captured by **Stop-Profiling** in trace.etl:

1. Open the trace.etl file in WPA.
1. Configure the WPA Symbol paths to point to the application symbols and the Microsoft public symbol server:

   :::image type="content" source="images/app-isolation/acp-doc-wpa-configure-symbols.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing Windows Performance Analyzer loading symbols":::

1. Load the symbols.
1. Apply the profile in ACP-StackTrace.wpaProfile to view the access attempt stack visualization:
